## Introduction:
where we give a high-level description of the eau2 system.

## Architecture:
where we describe the various part of eau2 at a high-level.

## Implementation:
difficult to understand, 
how network, how key value store
where we describe how the system is built, this can include a description of the classes and their API, but only the class you deem relevant and worth describing. (For example: do not describe the utility classes.)

## Use cases:
put time;
read a dataFrame for first week
examples of uses of the system. This could be in the form of code like the one above. It is okay to leave this section mostly empty if there is nothing to say. Maybe just an example of creating a dataframe would be enough.

## Open questions:
where you list things that you are not sure of and would like the answer to.

//need filereader?
//what is the net in application?
//

## Status:   
This week we set up the directories as required and wrote tests for key/value store.
